# 🏨 Roomify — Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

**Maximize revenue with AI-driven dynamic pricing for hotel chains.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Static pricing makes hotels lose money during demand fluctuations. Traditional fixed pricing strategies fail to capture revenue opportunities during peak demand periods and struggle to maintain occupancy during low-demand seasons.

## 💡 Solution

Roomify's dynamic pricing engine uses machine learning to predict demand and recommend optimal prices that maximize both revenue and occupancy. The system analyzes historical patterns, competitor pricing, seasonal trends, and market conditions to provide real-time pricing recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Global Insights Dashboard
- **KPI Monitoring**: Track occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and revenue growth
- **Occupancy Trends**: Visualize seasonal patterns and demand fluctuations over time
- **Price Elasticity Analysis**: Understand how price changes impact demand across different seasons
- **Competitive Positioning**: Monitor pricing relative to competitors and market trends

### 🎯 Dynamic Pricing Simulator
- **Real-time Optimization**: Calculate optimal prices for any given scenario
- **Revenue Maximization**: Find the sweet spot between price and occupancy
- **Business Insights**: Get actionable recommendations with revenue impact analysis
- **Price Sensitivity Testing**: Understand how demand responds to price changes

### 🔍 Scenario Explorer
- **Competitor Analysis**: Test impact of competitor price changes
- **Seasonal Strategies**: Compare performance across different seasons
- **Holiday Pricing**: Optimize pricing for special events and holidays
- **Weekend vs Weekday**: Analyze day-of-week pricing strategies

### 📈 Model Performance
- **Machine Learning Metrics**: Monitor model accuracy and performance
- **Feature Importance**: Understand which factors most influence demand
- **Data Quality**: Track data coverage and quality metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
